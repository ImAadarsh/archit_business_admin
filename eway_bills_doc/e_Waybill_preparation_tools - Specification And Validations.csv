,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"3)If the distance is passed as ‘0’ (Zero) and the distance between the PIN codes provided is available in E Way Bill database, the system will replace the distance as per the database. Passing ‘0’ is an indication that the user wants the system to take the distance as per the E Way Bill database",,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"6)If the distance between the two pin-codes provided is not available in E Way Bill database, E-waybill will be generated with an alert message as ""The distance between the given PIN codes are not available in the system."" and it’s a responsibility of the generator to provide correct distance in such cases.",,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"19)The system checks for the duplicate e-way bill on the same document number of the consignor. If already one e-way bill exists with same document number, the system will not allow generating one more e-way bill on the same number. That is, if the consignor is trying to generate multiple e-way bills based on one document number, the system throws error. Even if the consignee or transporter tries to generate an E Way Bill for the same document number, system will not allow generation of E Way Bill as consigner himself has used the document number for generation of E Way Bill.",,,,,,
,"However, if consignee or transporter tries to generate the multiple e-way bills on the same document number of the consignor, provided the consigner has not used the document number already to generate E Way Bill, the system will generate E Way Bill and alert through API to the consignee or transporter that already there is one e-way bill with that document number.",,,,,,
